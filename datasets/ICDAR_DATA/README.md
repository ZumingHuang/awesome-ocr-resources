> Demo images of ICDAR 2015.

The ICDAR 2015 datasets are from the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition, with 1000 natural images for training and 500 for testing. The images are acquired using Google Glass and the texts accidentally appear in the scene without user’s prior intention. All the texts are annotated with word-level quadrangles.
