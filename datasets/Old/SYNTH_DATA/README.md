> Demo images of SynthText in the wild dataset.

This is a synthetically generated dataset, in which word instances are placed in natural scene images, while taking into account the scene layout. The dataset consists of 800 thousand images with approximately 8 million synthetic word instances. Each text instance is annotated with its text-string, word-level and character-level bounding-boxes.
